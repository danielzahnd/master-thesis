# nf-milne-eddington-example-1-nflows-piecewisequadratic
This code experiments with normalizing flows used to invert Milne-Eddington atmospheres. In this case, a map of a certain FOV of the sun is taken and inverted using the Milne-Eddington algorithm. Train and test splits are subsequently made, where a normalizing flow (piecewise quadratic method from nflows package) is trained on the train split and tested on the test split. It provides an inital test for the idea, that inversions can be vastly accelerated by means of using normalizing flows. That is, a map is initially inverted using a (sophisticated) inversion algorithm. After that, a normalizing flow can be trained on this inverted map and then applied to similar FOV's and maps, thereby greatly accelerating the inversion and furthermore providing one with not only parameter values, but distributions!
