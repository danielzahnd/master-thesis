# nf-polynomial-regression-example
This Jupyter notebook explores an affine coupling layer normalizing flow built from scratch and applied to data, which is conditioned by context. The data in this case are parameters of a polynomial function to fourth degree. Furthermore, the context which conditions the parameters in the case at hand, are curves of a polynomial function generated by these parameters with some noise added to them.
