In this folder, all code used for the master thesis is stored. Furthermore, there is an educational Jupyter notebook `nf-affine-coupling-layer-normalizing-flow.ipynb` on normalizing flows to be found here, which features two example applications and can in principle be applied to any other suitable data of choice.
