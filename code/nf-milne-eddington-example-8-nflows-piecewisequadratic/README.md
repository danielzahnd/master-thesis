# nf-milne-eddington-example-8-nflows-piecewisequadratic
This code experiments with normalizing flows used to invert Milne-Eddington atmospheres. In this case, a single map of penumbra formation maps (Stokes parameters at different wavelengths for each pixel) is considered for training. This map is inverted using a Milne-Eddington algorithm. The spectrum data is subsequently interpolated to have more wavelength points, before training the flow. A normalizing flow is trained on this data (observations and corresponding inverted data). On samples of a prior unseen map of data of the same penumbra formation dataset, the normalizing flow is then tested and compared to the corresponding result of an MCMC inversion using the Milne-Eddington model.
