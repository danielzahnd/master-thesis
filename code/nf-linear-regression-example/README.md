# nf-linear-regression-example
This Jupyter notebook explores an affine coupling layer normalizing flow built from scratch and applied to data, which is conditioned by context. The data in this case are parameters of an affine function. Furthermore, the context which conditions the parameters in the case at hand, are lines of an affine function generated by these parameters with some noise added to them. The parameter dataset consists of a multitude of slope parameters and intercept parameters.
