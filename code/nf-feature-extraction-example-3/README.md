# nf-feature-extraction-example-3
This is an example application of normalizing flows built in PyTorch from scratch, using affine coupling layers as building blocks of diffeomorphisms implementing the normalizing flow. In the code available here, such a normalizing flows is applied to a feature extraction problem from solar phyics. The goal for the normalizing flow is to learn the feature distribution of certain features extracted from spectra of the sun taken by the IRIS satellite.
